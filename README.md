* The Snake game was inspired by (https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial). 
Whilst I have tried to deviate as much as possible and add many additional features, there may be some similarities in the code


### Media
* The canvas image was taken from (https://pixabay.com)
* Icons used were from (https://fontawesome.com/)
* Game Over alert was created using SweetAlert2 (https://sweetalert2.github.io/). The script was downloaded directly to the project as the site advised that calling the script from their site could cause some performance issues
* Sound effects were taken from (https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
* The Haptics effect JavaScript file for Android phones was taken from (http://hapticsjs.org/)
* The script to enable controller inputs was taken from (https://github.com/alvaromontoro/gamecontroller.js/)
