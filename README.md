## Planning Stage

### Project Goals
The goal of this project was to create a simple game for users to play, whilst providing several customisable options as well as multiple control schemes for ease of use

### User Goals
The target user is someone who wants to kill some time with a simple fun game
 * A casual gamer
 * A user who likes to fill their time with something quick and easy
 * A user looking to play a game whilst commuting or on a break at work

 ### User Stories
 * As a user I want the site to be easy to use and easily navigable
 * As a user I want to be able to challenge myself to beat my previous best score
 * As a user I want to be able to customise my game area to look and feel exactly as I want it
 * As a user I want to be able to control the game easily
 * As a user I want to be able to pick up and play a simple fun game

 ### Design Goals
 * A simple minimilistic site that works on all devices
 * Customisation options
 * Easy to use controls
 * Be fun enough for users to return to the site and play again

### Design Choices
 
 #### Font
 Designing Snake I wanted to go for a retro feel and picked a single font from google fonts called Gemunu Libre which was in keeping with the minimilistic design and retro feel.

 #### Color Scheme
 As an initial color scheme I went with a smoky white background and a grey/silver game canvas and control area. This gives a good contrast but also stays in line with the retro theme. 
 For the Settings modal's I went for a bright yellow to really help it stand out and grab the users attention as they customise their game. 
 For the game itself I went with a green snake with red and green "apples" for food, trying to keep the colors as authentic as possible.
 * Background: #f5f5f5
 * Game Canvas and Information panels: #c0c0c0
 * Snake: #008000
 * Food: #C7372F
 * Bonus Food: #8DB600
 I used (https://userway.org/) to check the contrasting colors worked well

Whilst I have tried to deviate as much as possible and add many additional features, there may be some similarities in the code
